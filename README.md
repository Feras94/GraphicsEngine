# 3D Graphics and Game Engine

## Description
Fast and open source 3D Graphics and Game Engine written in C++ and DirectX 11 currently a work in progress, some features are complete while others are still WIP and others are highly unstable

## Features
- Actors and Components based architecture
- Prefabs System (for components and actors re-usability)
- High Level Rendering Manager
- Complete Material System
- 3d Models Import System using the great [Assimp library](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- UI using the awesome [ImGui library](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- Interactive level editor using the own engine rendering pipeline
- XML Serialization and DeSerialization using the [TinyXml library](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)
- Performance and profiling support using custom built profiling manager
- Configurable engine parameters using external configuration files
- Events Management and dispatching system for communication between the engine's systems, the components and the actors
- Resources Management and on-demand loading using custom built Resource Cache and Handles
- Easy Packages Management using Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) Package Manager
- Rendering Features:
  - Diffuse textures
  - Normal map textures
  - Specular maps textures
  - Real time shadows using shadow mapping technology
  - Directional lights
  - Point lights
  - Spot lights
  - Occlusion Culling (for limiting the number of rendered objects)
  - High level management for graphics objects and their lifespan (Buffers, Shaders, etc...)
  - Offline Render Targets Support
  - Multi-Viewport Support

## Installation
- start with cloning this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Feras94/GraphicsEngine.git GraphicsEngine
```
- clone and setup vcpkg ([See how to clone and compile the tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start))

- setup global package installation for vcpkg (requires admin account)
```
vcpkg integrate install
```

- install the project dependencies through vcpkg
```
vcpkg install assimp
vcpkg install directxtk
```

- open the included visual studio solution and start coding something great

## Usage
the included project comes with a demo project showing how to reference the engine code and also how to setup a basic scene
**currenlty the Assets folder needed to launch the demo application is missing from git and will be pushed as soon as possible**
More usage instruction will be posted soon!

## Contributing
Feel free to clone and fork the project and send pull requests or submit issues and we'll work on them as soon as possible!
